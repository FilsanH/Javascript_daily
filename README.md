# Javascript_daily

## Goal
Apply my JavaScript knowledge through completing beginner friendly projects. 

## How 
I wanted to focus on my vanilla JavaScript skills and came across the ‘15 Vanilla Javascript Projects’ tutorial by Coding Addict. I decided to download the source files and attempt implementing the projects myself and then watching the tutorials to see how a professional would implement the functions. 

## Built with 
Languages:  Javascript , HTML and CSS
